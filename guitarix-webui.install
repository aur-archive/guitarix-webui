Take a look here /usr/share/doc/guitarix-webui/README to know how does it work.
In order to simplify things this AUR package includes two script for running guitarix using a webui

- start_guitarix_webui
- start_guitarix_engine

execute them in that order to start a web server/ui and a guitarix engine, then open a browser at localhost:8000 and have fun!
